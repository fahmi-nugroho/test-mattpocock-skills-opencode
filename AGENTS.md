## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as local markdown under `.scratch/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Git commits

Commit under the user's configured git identity — the one `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` report. Run a plain `git commit`, with no `-c user.name` / `-c user.email` flags, so every commit is attributed to the user.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
